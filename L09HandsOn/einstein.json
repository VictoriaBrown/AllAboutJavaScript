  "bio" : "Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist[5] who developed the theory of relativity, one
   of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[4][6]:274 His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
   science.[7][8] He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed 'the world's most
   famous equation'.[9] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery
   of the law of the photoelectric effect',[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory."
