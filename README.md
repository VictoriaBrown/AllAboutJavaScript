## L02HandsOn
This was an assignment completed for college. Within this folder, you'll find an index.html page and a script.js file. Within the JS file, you'll find an object named idealCar with the following properties: name property, color property, weightInPounds property, and a method myCar that takes values and adds them together and outputs them as a console.log(). The HTML document calls this method.

## L03HandsOn
This was an assignment completed for college. Within this folder, you'll find an index.html page and a script.js file. Within the JS file, you'll find a switch..case statement that checks highSchoolGrade and sets the grade according to the correct term. (For example 9=Freshman and 12=Senior). The default case sets grade to Invalid. Part 2 of this assignment was to change the following if..else to a ternary.

'''
  function name() {
    if (firstName === "John") {  
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello John!";  
    }  
    else {  
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Human!";  
    }  
}  
''''
